 <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>
    This archive was created as a space to host real medical imagery, including surgical photos, trauma cases, and pathological conditions, for <strong>educational and archival purposes</strong>. The goal is to document the reality of the human body—its fragility, complexity, and resilience—without censorship, sensationalism, or exploitation.

    Originally, this project lived on <strong>Tumblr</strong>, but due to content restrictions and eventual removal, it has found a new home here. All content is posted with <strong>intent to educate</strong>, and appropriate <strong>content warnings</strong> are provided for viewer discretion.
